# Universal-Traffic-Controller
This project serves as the capstone assignment for the Microcontroller System Design course. Using the STM32446RE board and Keil, the task was to create a physical setup and code a program for a multi-mode traffic controller that at the least included: a mode for a Rural Traffic controller implemented as a Finite State Machine, a mode for an Urban Traffic Controller with an interrupt-based pedestrian crosswalk feature, and a human-machine interface using a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). The traffic controller described in this report implemented the Urban Traffic Controller as a Finite State Machine to make the comparison of the functions of the Urban and Rural Controllers easier. In addition, this traffic controller included two extra modes: a mode for a Four-Way Yield, in which the lights blink yellow, and a mode for Four-Way Stop, in which the lights blink red. These modes were added to simulate more of the functions of a real traffic controller.
